        </P>This website is part of a graded lab in my Web Programming and Designing course. This course is complicated for me because I have no experience in designing, coding or anything computers. I am trying to learn. I like my Prop because he is knowledgeable. I enjoy web programming and design for the endless creative possibilities it offers and the power it provides to bring ideas to life in the digital world. Web programming allows me to turn my visions into interactive and functional websites, applications, and user experiences. </p>
